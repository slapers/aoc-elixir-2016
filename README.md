# Adventofcode

Solutions to the advent of code 2016 written in elixir.
I started the first day without having written anything in elixir, hoping to
learn elixir while doing the aoc
Also i started coding on day 7 or so.. so i'm running a bit behind :-)

I really appreciate if you have comments/feedback/rants...anything that helps
me get better at this.
